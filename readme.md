Welcome to Sing Along !!
<br>
It is a command line based application to scrap lyrics from 'lyricsgram' website and put them into '.txt' file.
<br>
There are two ways to do so -

1. By directly putting link into command line interface.
2. By giving multiple links through _'links.txt'_ file of _'/Lyrics_links'_ path of current working directory. Each single line contains only one link.
   <br>
   All the lyrics will be saved with their name as in the website. The folder is _'Lyrics_data'_ in currenrt working directory.
