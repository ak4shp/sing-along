Welcome to Sing Along !!
<br>
It is a command line based application to scrap lyrics from 'lyricsgram' and 'Gaana.com' website and put them into '.txt' file.
<br>
Both English version (i.e. http://www.lyricsgram.com/...) and Hindi version (i.e. http://hindi.lyricsgram.com/...) are supported.
<br>

There are two ways to do so -

1. By directly putting link into command line interface.
2. By giving multiple links through _'links.txt'_ file of _'/Lyrics_links'_ path of current working directory. 

Each single line contains only one link.

All the lyrics will be saved with their name as in the website. The folder is _'Lyrics_data'_ in currenrt working directory.
